#### Pending & In-Progress Tasks
- Update the 3D CAD models (GM-0003, GM-0004) to reflect the corrected vapor core dimensions, accounting for the total stacked wick thickness.
- Continue writing the mathematical justification document, moving on to the pressure balance and thermal resistance network sections.
- Finalize the MATLAB script now that the core equations have been verified and corrected.

#### Completed Tasks
- Reviewed math in code and realized I had an error when calculating. I stepped through the code and realized I had incorrect assumptions about a few equations. I optimized the code
- Corrected Vapor Pressure Drop Calculation
  -  Issue: I was missing a factor of 2 in the denominator of the Darcy-Weisbach equation for pressure loss
  -  Fix: Added the missing factor of 2 on both the dP_v calculation and the corresponding vapor_pressure-term to find Q_max
-  Redefined the vapor flow constant
  - Issue: F*Re was not correct for the vapor core geometry
  - Fix: Updated C_Vapor to 96, which seems more in line with the geometry that we have. This is for laminar flow between two flat plates, which is more effective compared to the heat pipe constant.
- Corrected the Effective wick thermal conductivity
  - The og formula had it as if the wick was a solid block of copper and the liquid was suspended within it. I changed the equation to have the liquid k_l as the continuous phase and the wire mesh as the dispersed material.
    - This was changed by changing the leading term to k_l and flipping signs inside the fraction.
- Optimized the condenser area calculation
  - Issue: The condenser area was simplified as the total internal area of the vapor chamber.
  - Fix: Updated the calculation to be more physically accurate by defining the condenser area as the total internal area minus the evaporator area
- Met with Dr. Banks
  - Sent him a progress update on the code updates and the reasoning for the prototyper fabrication hold.
  - Got good feedback on my solo work so far.
