#### Completed Tasks

* **GitHub Repository Established**
    * Created a central repository on GitHub to manage all thesis-related data, including code, CAD files, experimental data, and notes.

* **1D Simulation Code Developed**
    * Created and polished a 1D analytical model in MATLAB to predict vapor chamber performance. The code was refined for formatting and error handling using Gemini.

* **Initial 3D CAD Models Created (C11000 Copper)**
    * **Evaporator (Top Plate, GM-0003):** Designed with a uniform thickness of 2.25mm. Posts added for structural support during vacuum pulling.
    * **Condenser (Bottom Plate, GM-0004):** Designed with a uniform thickness of 2.25mm and features an inset groove to aid in solder application during assembly.

* **Manufacturing & Assembly Research Conducted**
    * Contacted Manufacturers for quotation on 4 sample chambers.
        * Sending files when 1D code is polished.
    * **Charging/Vacuum Method:** Consulted with a technician and determined the optimal method is to use a service access valve with an integrated Schrader valve. This component will be soldered to the main vapor chamber body for easy and repeatable vacuum pulling and charging.
    * Example valve: ![example](https://fanovo.com/wp-content/uploads/HVAC-Access-Valve.jpg)
    * **Soldering Material:** Selected a high silver content solder. This type is ideal for creating strong, vacuum-tight bonds with copper, as validated by its use in HVAC applications.

* **Component Procurement**
    * Ordered and received the screen mesh wicks required for fabrication (200 Mesh and 80 Mesh).
