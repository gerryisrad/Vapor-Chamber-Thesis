\#### Completed Tasks



\* \*\*GitHub Repository Established\*\*

&nbsp;   \* Created a central repository on GitHub to manage all thesis-related data, including code, CAD files, experimental data, and notes.



\* \*\*1D Simulation Code Developed\*\*

&nbsp;   \* Created and polished a 1D analytical model in MATLAB to predict vapor chamber performance. The code was refined for formatting and error handling using Gemini.



\* \*\*Initial 3D CAD Models Created (C11000 Copper)\*\*

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Evaporator (Top Plate, GM-0003):\*\* Designed with a uniform thickness of 2.25mm. Posts added for structural support during vacuum pulliing

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Condenser (Bottom Plate, GM-0004):\*\* Designed with a uniform thickness of 2.25mm and features an inset groove to aid in solder application during assembly.



\* \*\*Manufacturing \& Assembly Research Conducted\*\*

&nbsp;   \* Contacted Manufacturers for quotation on 4 sample chambers

&nbsp;	    \* Sending files when 1D code is polished

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Charging/Vacuum Method:\*\* Consulted with a technician and determined the optimal method is to use a service access valve with an integrated Schrader valve. This component will be soldered to the main vapor chamber body for easy and repeatable vacuum pulling and charging.

&nbsp;   \* Example valve !\[example](https://fanovo.com/wp-content/uploads/HVAC-Access-Valve.jpg)

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Soldering Material:\*\* Selected a high silver content solder. This type is ideal for creating strong, vacuum-tight bonds with copper, as validated by its use in HVAC applications.



\* \*\*Component Procurement\*\*

&nbsp;   \* Ordered and received the screen mesh wicks required for fabrication (200 Mesh and 80 Mesh).
