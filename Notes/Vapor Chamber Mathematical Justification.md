This document is created to evaluate the performance of my experimental vapor chamber (VC) model. This is a 1-D, steady-state, analytical approach to solving for the performance of my conceptual VC. This document will serve as a helper-style guide to better understand the MATLAB code used to solve for a feasible VC. The script was made to provide a quick, first-order prediction of the two performance metrics that define a VC's usefulness. 


The first of these metrics is the **capillary heat transport limit ($Q_{max}$)**, which defines the maximum heat transfer rate that the VC can achieve before capillary (wick) limitations begin to cause failure during operation. This is typically attributed to a wick's inability to return sufficient liquid to the evaporator section of the VC, thereby failing to match the actual evaporation rate of the liquid under vacuum.
