## 📐 CAD Files
The `CAD/` directory contains the 3D models for all mechanical components of the vapor chamber and experimental test fixture.

* **Software Used:** Solidworks 2024
* **Key Files:**
    * `GM-0005.SLDASM`: The main assembly file for the complete vapor chamber.
    * `GM-0003.SLDPRT`: The top half of the VC shell with integrated support columns.
    * `GM-0004.SLDPRT`: The bottom half of the VC shell.
* **Package Folder:**
    * Contains production step files and engineering drawings for fabrication. `Archive` is used for revision control.
* **Notes:** All dimensions are in millimeters. Fabrication drawings are included in PDF format.

## 🔬 Experimental Setup & Procedure
The `Experiment/` directory contains all information related to the physical testing of the vapor chamber prototypes.

### Hardware
* **Heating:** TBD: 150W heating element
* **Cooling:** TBD: A liquid-cooled cold plate connected to a recirculating water chiller.
* **Data Acquisition:** TBD: Thermocouples
* **Vapor Chamber:** Custom-fabricated copper vapor chamber with a multi-layer screen mesh wick, charged with deionized water.

### Procedure
1.  **Assembly:** Ensure consistent mounting pressure and uniform application of thermal interface material between the VC and the heater/cooler blocks.
2.  **Vacuum & Charging:** Evacuate the chamber to a target pressure of <10 Pa using an HVAC Vacuum pump. Charge with the calculated volume of deionized water using a precision syringe.
3.  **Testing:** Apply power to the heater in 10W increments, allowing the system to reach steady-state at each interval. Log temperature data continuously at 1 Hz.
4.  **Data Collection:** All raw experimental data is stored in the `Experiment/Data/` sub-folder in `.csv` format.

## 💻 MATLAB Simulation Code
The `Code/` directory contains the 1D analytical model used for design and performance prediction.

* **File:** `VaporChamberCalcs1D.m`
* **Description:** This script models the vapor chamber's performance by balancing the wick's capillary pressure against the liquid, vapor, and gravitational pressure drops. It calculates the maximum heat transport capacity (Q_max) and the total thermal resistance.
* **How to Run:**
    1. Open the script in MATLAB.
    2. Modify the parameters in the "USER-DEFINED INPUTS" section to match your design.
    3. Run the script.
    4. Results will be displayed in the command window.
